This package contains a freely distributable version of the Sherlock Holmes
search engine -- a system for gathering and indexing of textual data (text
files, web pages, ...), both locally and over the network.

Features:

  o  Gathers files via HTTP or from local files.

  o  Parses text files, HTML, PDF, and several other formats using external
     parsers (such as MS Word and PostScript).

  o  The whole system is modular, so adding your own data sources
     or parsers is just matter of plugging in right module (well,
     usually also writing it :) ).

  o  Works well in mixed charset environment.

  o  Considers multiple occurences of the same file (even with minor
     changes) a single document with multiple URL's.

  o  Everything is highly configurable. You can write filtering
     rules in a special language which allows to tweak configuration
     variables depending on the document being processed.

  o  Searching of words, phrases and boolean expressions. Searching in
     filenames and link texts.

  o  Proximity search and proximity weighting of regular searches.

  o  Recognition of languages, easy integration of stemmers and synonymic
     dictionaries.

  o  Spelling checker based on word frequencies observed in the indexed
     data, hinting the user that his query might be misspelled.

  o  Search results include context in each document.

  o  Scales well to tens of millions of documents on normal PC hardware.

  o  User interface (the front-end) is completely separated from the
     rest of the system, making it easy to modify and also to embed
     the search engine in existing applications.

  o  Downloaded files and indices are compressed to save space.

The first version was developed back in 1997 and called Sherlock, but later
Apple started distributing another program of the same name as part of their
OS X, so we decided to rename the whole package to Sherlock Holmes to avoid
at least part of the confusion. The old name still persists at many places,
though.

License:

The program is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.
Some libraries and support modules are distributed under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) and some example programs are public
domain. In all such cases, it's clearly stated in comments at the start
of the module.

There also exists a commercial version of the search engine which
contains many additional features and you can get paid support for it.
If you are interested in it, please contact us.  The feature list
follows:

 o  site compression (the search server only shows up to 2 pages from
    one domain),
 o  automatic page ranking (based on the links between the pages),
 o  brand new distributed gatherer (it chooses which pages to gather
    according to their ranks, it is much faster and more scalable, and
    it can refresh pages much more often),
 o  connection with a catalog (human-administrated titles and keywords are
    taken into account during the search, and displayed with the results),
 o  internal MS Word and MS Excel parsers,
 o  indexing of images,
 o  search server multiplexer to load the balance,
 o  splitting the index into independent areas (one search engine for a
    number of domains).

Also, donations for development of features you'd like to use are welcome.
So much for advertisements :)

If you want to incorporate Sherlock in your applications or to use it
for whatever non-standard purposes you'd like, please contact the
authors -- licenses for such cases are available as well and in case
of academic research and non-profit projects, they are usually provided
free of charge.

For instructions on installation, see doc/install. For more information,
consult the other files in the doc directory.

You can find information about new versions at the project's
homepage at http://www.ucw.cz/holmes/. You can see Holmes in action
at http://www.morfeo.cz/ where it searches in the whole domain .cz.

All reports of bugs or inconveniences and also ideas for new features
(or patches implementing them :-) ) are welcome at holmes-bugs@ucw.cz.

		Happy gathering, indexing and searching!
