<h1><a name="intro">Sherlock Holmes Search Engine</a></h1>

<h2>What's that?</h2>

<p>
<em>Sherlock Holmes</em> is a universal search engine &ndash;
a system for gathering and indexing of textual, image, and audio
data (text files, web pages, ...), both locally and over the network.
Better than explaining what does such a thing really mean, let's
look at some of its features:
</p>

<h2><a name="features">Features</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>
Gathers files via HTTP or from local files.
</li>

<li>
Parses text files, HTML, PDF, MS Word, MS Excel, and several other formats
using external parsers (such as PostScript).  Parses JPEG, PNG, and
GIF images, stores their thumbnails, detects duplicates, and searches for
similar images.  Parses MP3 and OGG files, and stores their ID3 tags.
</li>

<li>
The whole system is modular, so adding your own data sources or parsers is just
a matter of plugging in the right module (well, usually also writing it :) ).
</li>

<li>
Works well in mixed charset environment.
</li>

<li>
Considers multiple occurences of the same file (even with minor changes) a
single document with multiple URL's.
</li>

<li>Site compression (the search server may only show the best 2 pages from one
domain).</li>

<li>Automatic page ranking (based on the links between the pages).</li>

<li>New intelligent gatherer (it chooses which pages to gather according to
their ranks, it is much faster and more scalable, and it can refresh pages much
more often than the old gatherer from before v4.0).</li>

<li>Splitting the index into independent areas (one search engine for a
number of domains).</li>

<li>
Everything is highly configurable. You can write filtering rules in a special
language which allows to tweak configuration variables depending on the
document being processed.
</li>

<li>
Searching of words, phrases, and boolean expressions.
Searching in file names and link texts.
</li>

<li>
Proximity search and proximity weighting of regular searches.
</li>

<li>
Recognition of languages, easy integration of stemmers and synonymic
dictionaries.
</li>

<li>
Spelling checker based on word frequencies observed in the indexed
data, hinting the user that his query might be misspelled.
</li>

<li>
Search results include context in each document.
</li>

<li>
Scales well to tens of millions of documents on normal PC hardware.
</li>

<li>
User interface (the front-end) is completely separated from the rest of the
system, making it easy to modify and also to embed the search engine in
existing applications.
</li>

<li>
Downloaded files and indices are compressed to save space.
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="license">License</a></h2>

<p>
Currently, two versions of Holmes exist.
The freely distributable version is licenced under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
(GPL).  Some libraries and support modules are distributed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser General Public
License</a> (LGPL) and some example programs are public domain. In
all such cases, it's clearly stated in comments at the start of the module.
</p>

<p>
The commercial version of the search engine contains some additional features
and you can get paid support for it.  If you are interested in it, please
contact us.  The feature list follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distributed gatherer (downloading documents much faster than any single
  machine could do).</li>
  <li>Distributed search server (serving documents at arbitrary load).</li>
  <li>Connection with a catalog (human-administrated titles and keywords are
  taken into account during the search, and displayed with the results).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, donations for development of features you'd like to use are welcome. So
much for advertisements :)
</p>

<p>
If you want to incorporate <em>Holmes</em> in your applications or to use it for
whatever non-standard purposes you'd like, please contact the <a
href="#authors">authors</a> &ndash; licenses for such cases are available as well
and in case of academic research and non-profit projects, they are usually
provided free of charge.
</p>

<h2><a name="download">Download</a></h2>

<p>
The current version of <em>Holmes</em> is 4.0.
You can download it via <a href="http://www.ucw.cz/holmes/download/">HTTP</a>
and <a href="ftp://www.ucw.cz/pub/holmes/">FTP</a>. For instructions on installation,
see <tt>doc/install</tt> in the archive. Debian packages are available as well.
</p>

<p>
There is currently no mailing list of Holmes users, but you can find
information about new releases at these pages and also in <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/holmes/">FreshMeat</a>.
</p>

<p>
Several libraries from the Holmes project can be also used separately,
so we have prepared a stand-alone library package. See the <a
href='/libucw/'>libUCW home page</a> for more information.
</p>

<h2><a name="authors">Authors</a></h2>

<p>
In short: Holmes has been written by <a href="http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mj/">Martin Mare&scaron;</a>
and <a href="http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~robert/">Robert &Scaron;palek</a>.
The development has been heavily sponsored by <a href="http://www.netcentrum.cz/">Netcentrum s.r.o.</a>
which is also one of the most important users and works as an exclusive distributor
of the <a href="#commercial">commercial version</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here is the full story: Back in 1997, Martin Mare&scaron; wrote the first version
called Sherlock 1.0 as his term project at <a href="http://www.mff.cuni.cz/">MFF UK</a>,
but it somehow escaped from his control soon &ndash; in October 1997 it was
indexing the whole <code>.cz</code> domain in cooperation with the Bajt company.
</p>

<p>The time slowly passed by, the author was busy working on other stuff,
Bajt had its own problems and the whole project would have been almost forgotten
weren't it for people from Netcentrum who were building a new Czech portal,
wanted to use Sherlock for searching and were willing to sponsor its further
development.
</p>

<p>
After several years of successfully running Sherlock 1.2 on a couple of servers,
Robert &Scaron;palek joined the "team" and together we decided to rewrite the
whole project from scratch and change the whole architecture (confirming the
ancient wisdom that every good program including TeX has to be rewritten at
least once in its lifetime :) ). Unfortunately, we have been forced to delay
the public release of this version for some time. So was it back in 2001.
</p>

<p>
In September 2002, we have resurrected the freeely distributable version of
Sherlock, but in the meantime Apple started distributing another program of
the same name as part of their OS X, so we decided to rename the whole package
to <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> (or Holmes) to avoid both confusion and trademark
problems.
</p>

<p>
In April 2009, we have moved most of the features from the commerial version to
the free version, and released the package as version 4.0.  The main
distinction between the two versions is now that the commercial version can
work distributed over many computers, whereas the free version only supports a
single machine.
</p>

<h2><a name="bugs">Reporting bugs</a></h2>

<p>
All reports of bugs or inconveniences and also ideas for new features (or
patches implementing them :-) ) are welcome at <a
href="mailto:holmes-bugs@ucw.cz">holmes-bugs@ucw.cz</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you use Holmes to your pleasure, the authors will be glad to hear about
your experience at the same address.
</p>

<h2 id="libs">Libraries</h2>

<p>
Many pieces of code developed originally for Holmes are now available
as separate libraries for use in other projects. If you are interested,
take a peek at <a href="/libucw/">the UCW Library</a>.
