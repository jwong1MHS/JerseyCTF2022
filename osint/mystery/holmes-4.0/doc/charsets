How to add a charset :
======================

1. download a mapping of the characters in a new charset to Unicode characters
   and put it into charset/set/
2. edit charset/misc/chartable.in, charset/charconv.h (enum charset_id), and
   charset/setnames.c, and add your newly inserted charset everywhere
2. download
      http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt
   and put it into charset/unidata/
3. cd charset && sh misc/generate
   this generates new source files and headers files for these charsets; commit
   these files to your repository
4. edit cf/gatherer and add your charset to the section Charset, in particular
   attribute Charset.Charset
5. if your new charsets are typical for web-pages written in some particular
   language, add it to LangFamily.AutoSets
6. if the charset is often mistaken for another one, such as iso-8859-2 vs.
   windows-1250, add a list of typically mistaken characters to
   LangFamily.CImprobable
